# upend

build script i've been using for a while now privately for various projects.

I've been using something like the directory implementation for a very long time now, the rest of the stuff tends to vary very widely between implementations (yes i rewrite it every time i want to use it)

anyways, see example.js for a relatively nonsensical but reader friendly example usage.

gladly taking pull requests, feature requests, suggestions, etc.
